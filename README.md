Technologies Used: React, Node/Express, Heroku.

I created a basic Node/Express app to serve the data from the server-side. 
The data consisted on a simple array of objects that contained names of students with the their test scores out of 5.
I served the data on the endpoint https://invivo-backend.herokuapp.com/data.

I decided to implement the the client-side using React with Hooks.
I also used the coreUI React Template in order to setup a basic Admin Panel Layout.
Since I was not allowed to use any libraries for the chart itself, I went ahead and used the basic 'table' tools in HTML with the help of CSS design to create the table.
I used AXIOS to fetch data from the backend in order to display it in the front end.

The backend & frontend both were deployed using the Heroku platform.
